# JoinHub-Connecting-WVSU-Students-to-Organizations
JoinHub was created to make it easier for WVSU students to discover and join campus organizations. From academic societies to creative circles, JoinHub connects you with communities that match your passions and goals.
JoinHub is a mobile application designed to provide a centralized and user-friendly experience, helping students, especially freshmen  easily explore orgs, apply to join, and engage with their campus community through announcements and chat.
