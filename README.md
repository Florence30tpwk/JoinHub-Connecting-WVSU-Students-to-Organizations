JoinHub was created to make it easier for **West Visayas State University (WVSU)** students to discover and join campus organizations.  
From academic societies to creative circles, JoinHub connects you with communities that match your passions and goals.

JoinHub is a **mobile application** designed to provide a centralized and user-friendly experience, helping students — especially freshmen — easily explore organizations, apply to join, and engage with their campus community through announcements and chat.


##  Project Overview

JoinHub is a student **mobile engagement platform** that serves as a friendly guide to connect students with organizations that align with their personal interests, academic goals, and extracurricular passions. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by numerous options and scattered information, students can select their preferences and receive smart recommendations for relevant organizations through a guided app. The app features a personalized dashboard with joined orgs, upcoming events, and a live campus bulletin. Students can apply to orgs directly, bookmark those they’re interested in, and stay updated with event schedules and org announcements all in one place. 

JoinHub aims to help **students** — especially freshmen, find their community, connect with like-minded peers, and enrich their college experience in a user-friendly and accessible way.

With JoinHub, students can:

- Browse and filter organizations based on interests and categories  
- Apply to join organizations directly within the app  
- Receive updates through announcements and event notifications  
- Chat and connect with fellow members in their chosen communities  

JoinHub simplifies campus engagement by combining **discovery, communication, and participation** in one accessible mobile app.
